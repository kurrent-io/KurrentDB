# Release schedule

EventStoreDB has been renamed to KurrentDB, and has a new release schedule which you can find in [the latest documentation](https://docs.kurrent.io/server/latest/release-schedule/).

The LTS versions of EventStoreDB will still be supported for two years from their release date. This means that the following versions of EventStoreDB are still within Kurrent's support window:

* [EventStoreDB 24.10](https://docs.kurrent.io/server/v24.10/quick-start/) supported until October 2026.
* [EventStoreDB 23.10](https://docs.kurrent.io/server/v23.10/quick-start/) supported until October 2025.
