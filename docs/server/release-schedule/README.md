# Release schedule

The LTS versions of EventStoreDB will still be supported for two years from their release date. This means that the following versions of EventStoreDB are still within Kurrent's support window:

* [EventStoreDB 24.10](https://docs.kurrent.io/server/v24.10/quick-start/) supported until October 2026.
* [EventStoreDB 23.10](https://docs.kurrent.io/server/v23.10/quick-start/) supported until October 2025.
